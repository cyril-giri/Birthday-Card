# 🎉 Birthday Card (my lil sister made this lol)

So my little sister randomly made this cute animated birthday card using plain HTML/CSS/JS… and it actually came out pretty adorable, so I’m putting it on GitHub before she deletes it by mistake. 😂

## ✨ What this thing does

* You click **Open Birthday Card 🎁**
  → a popup appears
* There’s a **cake**, **balloons**, cute **candle flames**, the whole vibe
* Confetti falls like it’s a full-blown party
* You can **close** it and the confetti disappears
* All done with simple code, no frameworks, no nonsense

## 📂 Files

```
index.html   # everything inside one file because she said “it’s easier”
```

## 🎂 Stuff you can change

* The name on the cake
* The message
* Balloon colors
* Confetti amount
* Basically anything — it’s tiny and easy to edit

## 💖 Why this exists

My sister made it, I thought it was cute, end of story.
Feel free to fork it, remix it, send it to your friends on their birthday, whatever.
